***Story***
You got hired as an ambulance driver and your boss told you to be careful and take all the pacients in time. 
After 10 months your boss can trust in you more and he gave you the possibility to work more time.
Month 25. You're a well-known employee and now your boss gives you a new teritory. Don't be too happy as it is in the center of the city.
Don't crash in the buildings! 
When you will be a 30 months employee you will get a new ambulance which is stronger.
And that's it! I hope you'll enjoy the game ;)
