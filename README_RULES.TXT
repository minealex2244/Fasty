***Story***
You got hired as an ambulance driver and your boss told you to be careful and take all the pacients in time. 
After 5 months you're a well-known employee and now your boss gives you a new teritory. Don't be too happy as it is in the center of the city.
Don't crash in the buildings! 
You will have free service from 5 to 5 months.
And that's it! I hope you'll enjoy the game ;)
